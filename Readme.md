# Instructions

To test the application, you can run the provided scripts `compileJava.bat` and `runJava.bat`, but you need first to edit both files to change the value of JAVA_HOME

    set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_181
  
to point to your Java distribution folder (use Java 8+)

You can also import the project in your IDE of preference (I'm not uploading the project files as I don't know the evaluator's version of IDE, so you need to open the folder as a normal folder and then add the needed Java configuration. For ex. in Eclipse use File > Import... > Projects from Folder or Archive)
